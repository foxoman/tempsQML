# tempsQML
QML port of temps project

The project is created for demonstrations purposes, inspired by https://jackd248.github.io/temps/ 
The idea is to demostrate the ways of creating Qt/QML apps using mixed C++/QML/JS approach, which gives addition flexibility and performance comparing to pure QML/JS solutions
