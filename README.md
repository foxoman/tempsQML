# tempsQML
QML port of temps project

The project is created for demonstrations purposes, inspired by https://jackd248.github.io/temps/

The idea is to demostrate the ways of creating Qt/QML apps using mixed C++/QML/JS approach, which gives addition flexibility and performance comparing to pure QML/JS solutions

Tested with Qt 5.7

Weather map is using OpenWeatherMap QtLocation plugin which is written for this app
It will be available later

If some have better idea on UI/UX you are welcome :)

Videos playable under Android, now available
